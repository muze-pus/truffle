# `@truffle/db-kit`

Smart contract utility widget leveraging @truffle/db, a system of record for
blockchain metadata.

This tool provides a few utilities to demo @truffle/db and other Truffle
libraries. Since this is for demo purposes, please consider this package
experimental and subject to future deprecation: we plan to move these
utilities to be part of Truffle itself.

Thanks for trying this out! We hope you enjoy.

## Usage

Run this in a Truffle project directory:

```
npx @truffle/db-kit --network=<network-name>
```
