# truffle-artifactor

This package saves contract artifacts into JSON files

```javascript
const Artifactor = require("truffle-artifactor");
const artifactor = new Artifactor(__dirname);
artifactor.save({/*...*/}); // => a promise saving MyContract.json to a given destination
```

### Features

* Manages contract ABIs, binaries and deployed addresses, so you don't have to.
* Packages up build artifacts into `.json` files, which can then be included in your project with a simple `require`.
* Manages library addresses for linked libraries.

The artifactor can be used with [truffle-contract](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/truffle-contract), which provides features above and beyond `web3`:

* Synchronized transactions for better control flow: transactions won't be considered finished until you're guaranteed they've been mined.
* Promises. No more callback hell. Works well with `ES6` and `async/await`.
* Default values for transactions, like `from` address or `gas`.
* Returning logs, transaction receipt and transaction hash of every synchronized transaction.

### Install

```
$ npm install truffle-artifactor
```

### Example

Here, we'll generate a `.json` files given a JSON object like [truffle-contract-schema](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/truffle-contract-schema). This will give us a file which we can later `require` into other projects and contexts.

```javascript
const Artifactor = require("truffle-artifactor");
const artifactor = new Artifactor(__dirname);

// See truffle-schema for more info: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/truffle-contract-schema
const contract_data = {
  abi: ...,              // Array; required.
  unlinked_binary: "..." // String; optional.
  address: "..."         // String; optional.
};

artifactor.save(contract_data);
// The file ./MyContract.json now exists, which you can
// import into your project like any other Javascript file.
```

# API

#### `artifactor.save(contract_data)`

Save contract data as a `.json` file. Returns a Promise.

* `contract_data`: Object. Data that represents this contract:

    ```javascript
    {
      contract_name: "MyContract",  // String; optional. Defaults to "Contract"
      abi: ...,                     // Array; required.  Application binary interface.
      unlinked_binary: "...",       // String; optional. Binary without resolve library links.
      address: "...",               // String; optional. Deployed address of contract.
      network_id: "...",            // String; optional. ID of network being saved within abstraction.
      default_network: "..."        // String; optional. ID of default network this abstraction should use.
    }
    ```

#### `artifactor.saveAll(contracts)`

Save many contracts to the filesystem at once. Returns a Promise.

* `contracts`: Object. Keys are the contract names and the values are `contract_data` objects, as in the `save()` function above:

    ```javascript
    {
      "MyContract": {
        "abi": ...,
        "unlinked_binary": ...
      }
      "AnotherContract": {
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```
