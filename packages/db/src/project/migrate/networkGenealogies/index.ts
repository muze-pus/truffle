/**
 * Load NetworkGenealogy records for a given set of artifacts while connected
 * to a blockchain with a provider.
 *
 * This operates on a batch of artifacts, each of which may define a network
 * object for the currently connected chain. As part of the Project.loadMigrate
 * workflow, this process function requires artifact networks to be passed with
 * historic block information and a reference to the Network.
 *
 * We take, as a precondition, that all relevant artifact networks are actually
 * part of the same blockchain; i.e., that artifact networks represented by
 * later blocks do in fact descend from artifact networks represented by
 * earlier blocks.
 *
 * Using this assumption, the process is as follows:
 *
 *   1. Map + filter artifacts into artifact networks, excluding any unrelated
 *      artifact networks in each artifact.
 *
 *   2. Sort these artifact networks by block height.
 *
 *   3. For each pair of artifact networks in the sorted list, generate a
 *      corresponding NetworkGenealogyInput whose ancestor/descendant are
 *      Networks from the earlier/later item in the pair, respectively.
 *
 *   4. Connect this series of network genealogy records with existing
 *      genealogy records in the system by querying our input networks one at a
 *      time, looking for any known ancestor and/or any known descendant. If
 *      either or both of these relations exist, add corresponding genealogy
 *      inputs to our list.
 *
 *   5. Load all inputs as NetworkGenealogy resources
 *
 * Note: unlike other process functions in the larger Project.loadMigrate flow,
 * this does not use the batch abstraction, and thus does not return structured
 * data in the original input form. Although this function returns a list of
 * NetworkGenealogy ID objects, it is likely not necessary to capture this
 * information anywhere, and thus the return value can likely be discarded.
